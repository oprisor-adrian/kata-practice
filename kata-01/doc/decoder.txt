--- Case #1 ---

L - length of the encoded text
R - number of rails
k - number of chacrater of each rail


Case 1 applicable if L is multiple of 2(R-1):
L % [2 * (R-1)] = 0


Solution:
k = L / [2 * (R-1)]

Split the encoded text in first and last k characters. The middle of the text split in 2*k characters. The entier text should be splited in maximum R substrings (each substring representing each encoded rail).

Iterate over the substring vector back and forth, poping out the first character from each substring, and concatenate each of them in another string, until the original string is recreated.
